When it comes to the definition of unusual, I would prefer that to some kind of building that have a weird exterior or the interior was design in a very weird way. And I know a place matched with that definition, it's an internet gaming center that within a walking distance from my home.

I had a chance to known this place via my friend. The one that really enthusiasm in playing video games. 

There was one time that my friend invited me to have some matches of game with him, but he insisted that we must have game in his favorite internet center. He led me to that place, and I was surprised because all that showed in front of me was just a convenience store. I even asked him if we were at the wrong place but he told me wait and I would see the magic. He gave his member card to the staff of the store, after reviewing the card, the staff gave us a smile and open the hidden door behind him: a room with lines of computers. I was blown a way, because, you know, who could imagine that there is an computer game center in a convenience store.

Anyway, after that, we stepped into the room, turn on a couples of machine and enjoy playing games together. It was just like others gaming center but the surprising experience in the beginning was so amazing that I felt it even made games more exciting. And even up until today, I could vividly remember that feeling again.

All in all, that place existed as a hidden gem to any gamers who wish to escape from their daily mundane matters. Who could find them in that store? Who could envisage that they were sitting behind a computer in such place? I mean it was so mesmerizing and I would love to make that place become my favorite refuge.

We suffer from weariness of works, our task pile up as a mountain at that time. watch film, "hey, how about go to Vung Tau?" Go Vung Tau, on a whim, stupid, impulsive on the world. We decided and also prepared ours stuff just in that night. 12h midnight, 4h a.m completed the packing task, departed at 5 .a.m

Vung Tau?
Location?
How can we get there?
What we did?
just one day, even just 16hours, we relive the time that we was savoring carefree days.


It make us happier, spending time together, escape from. vanish all the stress into the air. Refresh our mind, cementing our friend ship.

Sometime, I think that we should have a trip with our dears, rather than burry ourself in to working and bills.
