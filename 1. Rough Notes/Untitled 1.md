**Young people committing crimes should be treated the same as adults by the authorities. To what extent do you agree or dissagree**

There are arguments that young's crimal behaviors and that of adults should be applied the same regulations by government. While I contend that this statement has its reasons, I firmly support that young criminers should have softer treatments than adults.

Regarding the proponent opinion, there were several cases indicate that current laws were not deterence enough when the culprits are in youth ages. Because of this, it is unable to prevent future criminals of these age groups. Acording to Daily News paper, crimal youngsters that already punished tend to continue happen the bad behaviors, showing that the regulations have little affect on them.

On the other hand, punishments put on the adults crime often severe and take plenty of time of a person's whole life, to just to be detained in prisons. If these regulations also be used for the youths, it would take away the opportunities to change and turn  potential seeds of society into individuals with prior convictions - people who are hard in finding job or even shelter because of their past. 

In summary, while we can not deny how little the laws are affect on criminal youngsters, authorities also should not too strict with them in order to foster and build up well behavior for them.
