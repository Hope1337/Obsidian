The diagram given demonstrates how electricity can be generated using water.

Overall, the process includes two main stages, beginning with the precipitation of water in nature and ending with the final electricity product allocated to many places.

At the first stage, water from sea experiences phases of evaporation and condensation which finally end up in an artificial reservoir surrounded with a dam. After that, the water flows along a predefined path through a valve to a turbine where it can be turned into electricity. Additionally, used water will then be carried back to its initial place using a pump.

The last stage is when raw electricity is preprocessed and distributed. At first, electric outputs from the first stage are transferred to and carried on a network of high voltages cables. Its next destination is the transformer station where the electricity is processed into suitable form before being assigned to many other areas.
