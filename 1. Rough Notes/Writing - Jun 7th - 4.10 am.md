The given line graph illustrates how much carbon dioxide emitted per capita on average in four different countries from 1967 to 2007.

Overall, while the amount of CO2 emission witnessed a downward trend in both the United Kingdom and Sweden, the opposite was true for Italy and Portugal. Additionally, the figure for the United Kingdom consistently dominated others.

Four tonnes of released CO2 gases were recorded in Italy in 1967, after which it gradually rose and surpassing the Sweden's line after the year 1987 before ending just under 8 tonnes in the end of the period. The similar patterns were seen in Portugal where its data started as the lowest at around 1 ton but then steadily grew to approximately 5 in 30 years latter. Consequently, the figure for Portugal showed a slighter increase compared to previous period before finishing at just over 5 tonnes in 2007.

Regarding to countries with a decrease tendency in the amount of discharged CO2 in tonnes. The data for The United Kingdom initially was at under 11 and witnessed a stable decline till 2007, which finally stood at roughly 9. On the other hand, the figure for Sweden was began at under 9, followed by a considerable change of over 2 tonnes in 1977. After that it dramatically decline to around 7 before further falling and together with Sweden, placing as the least line.
