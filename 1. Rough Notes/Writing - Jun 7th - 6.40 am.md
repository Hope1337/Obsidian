The diagrams given illustrate the layout of a school site in 2004 and the proposal for developments in the next 20 years.

Overall, accompanied with a significant increase in the number of students, several modifications are made. Specifically, additional building, road, and car park is built whereas the sports field is squeezed and relocated.

Regarding facilities, two of the old educational buildings still remain yet an connecting part between them is added. Furthermore, a new school building is constructed in place of the sports field, which is relocated, not far from its old location, to the southeast.

Concerning the transport infrastructure, the old path leading from the main entrance to the site of the old sports field is now shortened by nearly a half, helping to travel from the right front of school building 2 to the new building. On the other hand, a new, long road is developed, starting from the main entrance, passing through buildings and leading to a new site for car parking to the east. This site is built near the new sport filed, on the ground of old greenery land.
